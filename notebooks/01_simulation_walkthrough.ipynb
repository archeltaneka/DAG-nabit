    "1. ✅ Realistic customer generator with heterogeneous treatment effects\n",
    "2. ✅ Behavior simulator that creates observational data with confounding\n",
    "3. ✅ Ground truth labels to validate causal inference methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Hiring Managers:\n",
    "1. **Demonstrates deep understanding** of causal inference concepts\n",
    "2. **Shows engineering skills** - clean, modular, production-quality code\n",
    "3. **Business-oriented** - framed in terms of ROI and strategy\n",
    "4. **Innovative approach** - goes beyond static Kaggle datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Module 2**: Experimentation framework (A/B tests, observational studies)\n",
    "- **Module 3**: Causal inference methods (Propensity Score, Double ML, Uplift)\n",
    "- **Module 4**: Business intelligence dashboard and ROI calculator\n",
